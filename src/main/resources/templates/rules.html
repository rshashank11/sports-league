    <strong>Objective:</strong> The aim is to reduce your score from 301 to exactly zero.<br>
    <strong>Throwing:</strong> Each player throws three darts per turn. Players determine who goes first by throwing a single dart – closest to bull wins.<br>
    <strong>Scoring:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Points are scored by hitting various sections of the dartboard.</li>
        <li>The outer ring doubles the score of that section, and the inner ring triples it.</li>
        <li>Hitting the bullseye scores <span class="highlight">50 points</span>, and the outer bull scores <span class="highlight">25 points</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Finishing:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>To win, you must reach exactly zero by ending with a double (a dart that lands in the outer ring of a number) or a bullseye.</li>
        <li>If you score more than needed or fail to end on a double, your score for that turn is voided, and you try again on your next turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Turns:</strong> Players alternate turns, throwing three darts each time until one player reaches exactly zero.

    <strong>Basic Rules:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Coin Toss:</strong> Whoever wins the coin toss decides whether to serve first or choose a side of the table.</li>
        <li><strong>Service:</strong> The server must toss the ball and strike it so it bounces once on their side and once on the opponent's side.
            <ul>
                <li>If the ball touches the net but still lands on the opponent’s side, the serve is replayed (a "let").</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A point is scored after each ball is put into play.</li>
                <li>Points are awarded when the opponent fails to return the ball correctly.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Game Play:</strong>
    <p>The standard game in competitive table tennis is played to <strong>11 points</strong>. However, a player must win by at least a <strong>2-point margin</strong>.
    If the score ties at 10-10, play continues until one player gains a 2-point lead.</p>
    <strong>Match Format:</strong> A match is best of 3 games. Players should swap sides after every game played.
    <strong>Service Alternation:</strong> Players alternate serving every two points. In the event of a 10-10 tie, service alternates after every point.

    <strong>Rules:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rack Up:</strong> Get your table ready and set up your pack by following the pattern of red and yellow balls from the diagram.</li>
        <li><strong>Make a Break:</strong> The first player places the white ball behind the line and aims at the pack. A minimum of four balls must hit a cushion, otherwise, it’s a foul.</li>
        <li><strong>Reds or Yellows:</strong> The first player to hit any color legally into one of the pockets takes that color for the game. The other player takes the remaining color.</li>
        <li><strong>Pot to Win:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Pot a ball to get another go. Miss, and it's your opponent’s turn.</li>
                <li>Clear all your colors, and then pot the black eight-ball to claim victory.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Foul Play:</strong>
    <p>Should a foul occur, the opposing player receives <strong>two shots</strong>, which can be carried over (if a ball is potted on the first shot, the player still has two shots).
    When a player gets two shots, they can pick up the white ball and place it anywhere behind the line to gain some advantage over their opponent.</p>
    <strong>Fouls Include:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Hitting your opponent’s ball first.</li>
        <li>Completely missing all balls.</li>
        <li>Any ball jumps off the table.</li>
        <li>Potting the white ball.</li>
        <li>If you pot the eight-ball before all your other colors (you’ve lost the whole game).</li>
        <li>If you pot the eight-ball – at the right time – but the white ball then goes into a pocket (you’ve lost that game too).</li>
